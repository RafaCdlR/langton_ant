# Langton's Ant

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Langton's Ant (with two colors tiles).
The ant moves in a toroidal 2D space.

# Future

In the future I plan to add the next features:
- Dedicated GUI instead of displaying it on terminal.
- Control the simulation with the keyboard.
